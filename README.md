# CMS Style Tech Blog

## Description
This project was made to learn about working with deployed databases, as well as the handlebars framework for creating dynamic views. I learned that deploying to a live server is quite simple and just requires some extra process specification. I also learned how to use basic handlebars to render pages with dynamic information.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Go to the deployed application where you can see the home page with some seeded posts. Navigating to any other page or clicking login will prompt you to login or sign up for an account. After signing in, you can view posts, create posts, post comments, and delete posts.
